# 💫 About Me
I'm a Data Science student at the **University of Michigan** 〽️ specializing in **Quantitative Behavioral Optimization**. I’m obsessed with building intelligent systems that go beyond simple prediction to shape the user experience actively.

* **⚡ Optimization Junkie:** I don't just build models; I’m obsessed with the mathematical elegance of tuning feedback loops to drive real-world behavioral outcomes.
* **🏗️ Full-Cycle Architect:** I manage the full data lifecycle—from robust modeling in PyTorch to designing scalable pipelines that deliver clean, structured JSON to the front-end.
* **🎯 Career Goal:** Seeking 2026 internships in **Innovative Product Development** and **ML Engineering**.

## 🧠 The Obsession: ML & Optimization
I treat every project as an optimization problem. Why settle for a $90\%$ accuracy rate when you can optimize the entire system for a $10\%$ increase in user impact? 

- **The Goal:** Transforming "What will happen?" into "How do we make the best thing happen?"
- **The Craft:** I spend my time tuning hyperparameters and architecting low-latency pipelines because the bridge between **Data Science** and **Product** is where the real value is created.

## 📖 Learning Log: System Upgrades
*Currently iterating on my skill set to reduce the error rate of my deployments:*
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Moving from static predictions to dynamic agent-based decision-making.
- **System Design for ML:** Building high-throughput infrastructures to handle real-time data velocity.
- **Causal Inference:** Refining how I measure the impact of model-driven interventions.
